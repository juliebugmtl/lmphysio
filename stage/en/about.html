			<h1>About</h1>

			<figure id="photo"><img src="../images/profile.jpg" alt="Laurence Mignault"></figure>
			
			<p><strong>Laurence Mignault</strong> (M.Sc. PT) is a physiotherapist member of L'Ordre Professionnel de la Physiothérapie du Québec (OPPQ). She's been in the field of physiotherapy for 7 years now. She received her bachelor's and master's degrees in physiotherapy from the Université de Montréal. Her assessment and treatment approach is evidence-based, which is why she continues to take continuing education courses, including a specialization in advanced orthopedic manual therapy at the <a href="https://aqpmo.ca/en/" target="_blank">AQPMO</a> (Level II). She is also certified by the <em><a href="http://www.mytpi.com/" target="_blank">Titleist Performance Institute</a></em> (Level II, golf specialization) and the <em>Selective Functional Movement Assessment</em>.</p>

			<p>Since 2013, Laurence has been working as a physiotherapist at the Sports Medicine Clinic of Club Sportif MAA in downtown Montreal. She is also involved with golfers who are in the golf-study program at Collège de Montréal, Cégep André-Laurendeau, école secondaire De Mortagne and Cégep Édouard-Montpetit. Additionally, she collaborates with other young golfers from the Académie Golf Performance, directed by Daniel Langevin and Benoit Lemieux. In 2017, she decided to open her private office in her hometown of Varennes. She also created the "<a href="annualexam.html">Annual Preventive Physiotherapy Assessment</a>", an outpatient professional service offered to companies.</p>

			<p>Laurence strongly believes in a personalized and individual approach. She won't just ice your injured area or connect you to a machine. She will maximize your session time and educate you on your condition, treat you with advanced manual therapy techniques, as well as prescribe appropriate rehabilitation exercises. These exercises are just as important as the treatment as they will allow you to maintain the gains made during the session as well, allowing you to make progress between appointments. Nobody wants to be hurt and Laurence is well aware of it. That's why her goal is to get you back to your everyday activities and sports as quickly as possible, while giving you the tools to help you avoid the same situation from happening again in the future.</p>
